# Paths included in this file will not be searched when looking for tasks.
#This is accomplished by checking the path of each file against each line written here, so sometimes it pays to be precise.
# As an example, if you write "/Gamedev Toolbelt/" below every path will be tested for containing "/Gamedev Toolbelt/".
# If you create another folder called "Gamedev Toolbelt" somewhere else in the project (aside frome the one created by this extension), that too will be ignored.
# You can prevent this by including a bigger part of the path, for instance "/Gamedev Toolbelt/CodeTODOs/"
#
# You can include both folders and single files.
