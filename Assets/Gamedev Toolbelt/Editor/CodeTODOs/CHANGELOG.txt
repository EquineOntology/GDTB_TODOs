====== 1.2 =====

 * Completely redesigned how scripts were collected/processed, as autoupdating was slowing Unity to a crawl on sizeable projects.
   Users can now process scripts and tasks on demand through buttons on the main interface (new workflow described in README).
 * Added a Welcome window to give users a few pointers on startup.

====== 1.1 =====

 * FIX: EditorPrefs were not being initialized correctly on first start.
 * New icons and button style!
 * Buttons are now highlighted when hovered over.
 * FIX: Unity could freeze on very large projects due to auto-updating of the task list.

* Initial release
