Hello! This is Christian, the author of Code TODOs. I hope you're liking the extension!

If you're looking at this in the Unity inspector and wondering what all the visual
noise is, no worries! I just like using ASCII for titles, but I included a plaintext
version of all sub-heading just in case! :)

Enough from me, let's get to the interesting stuff!


     WHAT IS CODETODOS?

CodeTODOs is a small extension for Unity which collects any task you in your code and
displays them in Unity, to help you keep track of what you still need to do, where,
and the priority each task.

Every programmer is familiar with shortcuts, hacks, "throw NotImplementedException"
and so on. With CodeTODOs, you can simply add a small code to a comment in which you
describe the task, and get back to it when it's time without fear of forgetting what
you were doing, or of leaving the hack untouched altogether!



     HOW DOES IT WORK?

1) The first time you start CodeTODOs, click on "Process scripts" (or the button with
four circular arrows), which will create a list of all scripts in the project.
2) After that's done, click on "Refresh" (the button with a single circular arrow),
which will look through these scripts for tasks.

After that first time, you will only need to click "Refresh tasks" when you want to
update the list of task. If there are issues, the first thing you should do is to
process scripts again.


As for formatting the comments themselves as tasks, you can simply write something like
"//QQQ This gameobject should be grabbed by the code instead of dragged and dropped"
Note that QQQ (the "token") can be changed in the Preferences window.

Additionally, you can also exclude files or entire folders from the task list! You can
find more information in the exclude.txt file.

There's quite a bit to discover when it comes to what CodeTODOs can do, I suggest going
to http://immortalhydra.com/gamedev-toolbelt/code-todos/ to see everything the extension
has to offer :)



     WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION?

While there isn't much more to learn outside the CodeTODOs webpage, you can definitely
write me if you want to! You can reach me @hherebus on Twitter, or by writing me a
quick email at support@immortalhydra.com
