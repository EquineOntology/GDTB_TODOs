Hello! This is Christian, the author of Code TODOs. I hope you're liking the extension!

If you're looking at this in the Unity inspector and wondering what all the visual
noise is, no worries! I just like using ASCII for titles, but I included a plaintext
version of all sub-heading just in case! :)

Enough from me, let's get to the interesting stuff!

     WHAT IS CODETODOS?

CodeTODOs is a small extension for Unity which collects any task you in your code and
displays them in Unity, to help you keep track of what you still need to do, where,
and the priority each task.

Every programmer is familiar with shortcuts, hacks, "throw NotImplementedException"
and so on. With CodeTODOs, you can simply add a small code to a comment in which you
describe the task, and get back to it when it's time without fear of forgetting what
you were doing, or of leaving the hack untouched altogether!

     HOW DOES IT WORK?

You can simply write something like
"//QQQ This gameobject should be grabbed by the code instead of dragged and dropped"
in your code, and CodeTODOs will automatically pick it up when the script is imported
again, and save the file and its line number.

When you have some tasks filed, just open the main CodeTODOs window, click on the link,
and you'll even be brought to that script in your editor of choice!

Additionally, you can also exclude files or entire folders from the task list! You can
find more information in the exclude.txt file.

There's quite a bit to discover when it comes to what CodeTODOs can do, I suggest going
to http://immortalhydra.com/gamedev-toolbelt/code-todos/ to see everything the extension
has to offer :)

     WHERE CAN I FIND MORE INFORMATION?

While there isn't much more to learn outside the CodeTODOs webpage, you can definitely
write me if you want to! You can reach me @hherebus on Twitter, or by writing me a
quick email at support@immortalhydra.com
